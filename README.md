# OSRS-How-Long-Til-Dry
An Old School Runescape drop rate binomial probability calculator. 

This script will accept a drop rate, how many times the drop should occur, and the expected percentage of players to achieve that number of drops in order to produce a binomial probability graph.

The below example shows how many Vyres need to be pickpocketed for 50% of players to get two Blood Shard drops (8392, hope you enjoy the grind).
