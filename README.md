# OSRS-How-Long-Til-Dry
An Old School Runescape drop rate binomial probability calculator. 

This script will accept a drop rate, how many times the drop should occur, and the expected percentage of players to achieve that number of drops in order to produce a binomial probability graph.

The below example shows how many Vyres need to be pickpocketed for 50% of players to get two Blood Shard drops (8392, hope you enjoy the grind).

You can configure the drop rate, number of drops, and expected percent to any account goal via prompts this script generates -- no need to modify the existing Python script! For example, here's a configuration for five (5) Voidwaker Hilt drops off Callisto, and how many kills it would take for 80% of players to achieve this:
